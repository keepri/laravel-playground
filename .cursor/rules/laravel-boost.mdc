=== .ai/laravel12-fullstack-ai-guideline rules ===

You are an expert in PHP, Laravel 12, and full-stack development using Blade for frontend rendering. You write secure, testable, maintainable Laravel apps following official conventions and best practices.
## General code instructions
- Don't generate code comments above the methods or code blocks if they are obvious. Don't add docblock comments when defining variables, unless instructed to, like `/** @var \App\Models\User $currentUser */`. Generate comments only for something that needs extra explanation for the reasons why that code was written.
- For library documentation, if some library is not available in Laravel Boost 'search-docs', always use context7. Automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Other examples: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`, or `str()->slug()` instead of `Str::slug()`.
- Import all classes with `use` and reference only their short names; no fully-qualified class names in code.

## PHP Best Practices
- Use `declare(strict_types=1)` for strict typing.
- Avoid `var_dump`, use logging or `dd()` only in dev.
- Use type-hinting and return types.
- Use `readonly` properties and early returns.
- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Generate Enums always in the folder `app/Enums`, not in the main `app/` folder, unless instructed differently.
- Don't create temporary variables like `$currentUser = auth()->user()` if that variable is used only one time.
- Enums: If a PHP Enum exists for a domain concept, always use its cases (or their `->value`) instead of raw strings everywhere — routes, middleware, migrations, seeds, configs, and UI defaults.

## Laravel Structure
- Follow PSR-4 and default Laravel folder structure.
- Use `artisan` commands (`make:model`, `make:controller`, `make:request`).
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction in small/medium projects.
- I am using Laravel Herd locally, so always assume that the main URL of the project is `http://[folder_name].test`

## Routing
- Use `Route::resource` or `Route::apiResource`.
- Group by middleware (`auth`, `web`, `api`) and prefixes.
- Use route model binding; avoid closures in routes.

## Controllers
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in Service classes
- When generating Controllers, put validation in Form Request classes and use `$request->validated()` instead of listing inputs one by one.
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- Return JSON or views as appropriate.
- Use invokable controllers for single-use cases.
- Controllers: Single-method Controllers should use `__invoke()`; multi-method RESTful controllers should use `Route::resource()->only([])`
- Don't create Controllers with just one method which just returns `view()`. Instead, use `Route::view()` with Blade file directly.

## Models
- Use `$fillable` or `$guarded`.
- Define relationships clearly.
- Use `$casts` and query scopes.
- Add accessors and mutators for transformations.
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top

## Requests & Validation
- Use `FormRequest` classes.
- Use `authorize()` for access checks.
- Use reusable rules or custom Rule objects.

## Eloquent
- Don't use `whereKey()` or `whereKeyNot()`, use specific fields like `id`. Example: instead of `->whereKeyNot($currentUser->getKey())`, use `->where('id', '!=', $currentUser->id)`.
- Don't add `::query()` when running Eloquent `create()` statements. Example: instead of `User::query()->create()`, use `User::create()`.

## Blade Views
- Avoid business logic in templates.
- Use `@extends`, `@section`, `@include`, `@props`.
- Escape all output (`{{ }}`), only use `{!! !!}` when needed.
- Use components for reusability.
- In Livewire projects, don't use Livewire Volt. Only Livewire class components.

## API Resources
- Use `JsonResource` or `ResourceCollection`.
- Return proper HTTP codes (e.g. `201`, `204`, `422`).
- Hide sensitive data (e.g. passwords, tokens).

## Authentication
- Use Laravel Breeze, Jetstream, or Fortify.
- Use Sanctum for token-based APIs.
- Use middleware (`auth`, `throttle`, `can`) for protection.

## Authorization
- Use Policies for model-level access.
- Register policies in `AuthServiceProvider`.
- Use Gates for general checks.
- Use `authorize()` or `can()` in controllers and views.

## Testing
- Use PHPUnit with `php artisan test`.
- Use feature and unit tests.
- Use factories and `RefreshDatabase`.

## Jobs & Queues
- Use `make:job` and dispatch via `dispatch()`.
- Handle retries and failures.
- Use Horizon for queue management.

## Database
- For DB pivot tables, use correct alphabetical order, like "project_role" instead of "role_project"
- When creating pivot tables in migrations, if you use `timestamps()`, then in Eloquent Models, add `withTimestamps()` to the `BelongsToMany` relationships.

## Migrations & Seeders
- Use `foreignId()->constrained()` for relations.
- Add indexes.
- Use seeders and factories for dev/testing.
- When adding columns in a migration, update the model's `$fillable` array to include those new attributes.
- Never chain multiple migration-creating commands (e.g., `make:model -m`, `make:migration`) with `&&` or `;` — they may get identical timestamps. Run each command separately and wait for completion before running the next.

## Performance
- Use Redis/Memcached for cache.
- Use `Cache::remember()` for heavy queries.
- Run `config:cache`, `route:cache` in production.
- Consider Laravel Octane.

## Events & Observers
- Use observers for model hooks.
- Use events to decouple logic.
- Queue listeners for heavy operations.
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top

=== .ai/laravel12-api-ai-best-practices rules ===

You are an expert in PHP and Laravel 12. You write secure, testable, maintainable API applications using Laravel's conventions. Follow official documentation and best practices strictly. No Blade, no frontend. This is an API-only backend.

## General
- Use `declare(strict_types=1)` at the top of all PHP files.
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading and Laravel's default structure.
- Use `artisan` generators (`make:model`, `make:controller`, etc.).

## Routing
- Use `api.php` and `middleware('api')`.
- Prefer `Route::apiResource()` for RESTful routes.
- Use route model binding and avoid route closures.

## Controllers
- Keep controllers minimal, only orchestrate.
- Delegate logic to `Services`, `Actions`, or `Jobs`.
- Use `__invoke()` for single-action controllers.
- Return JSON or API Resources, not arrays.

## Models
- Use `$fillable` or `$guarded` to protect attributes.
- Use Eloquent relationships (`hasMany`, `belongsTo`, etc.).
- Use `$casts` to cast attributes (e.g. `'is_active' => 'boolean'`).
- Use accessors, mutators, and query scopes for logic.

## Validation
- Use `FormRequest` classes for validation and authorization.
- Add logic in `authorize()` method.
- Use `bail`, `sometimes`, `required_if`, and rule objects where needed.

## API Resources
- Use `JsonResource` and `ResourceCollection`.
- Use `with()` to append metadata (e.g. pagination).
- Avoid exposing sensitive fields.

## Auth & Security
- Use Laravel Sanctum for token-based auth.
- Protect routes with `auth:sanctum` middleware.
- Hash passwords using `Hash::make()` and validate with `Hash::check()`.
- Sanitize input and validate all request data.

## Authorization
- Use `Policies` for model actions and register them in `AuthServiceProvider`.
- Use `Gate` for general permission logic.
- Use `authorize()` in controllers to enforce policy checks.

## Testing
- Use `php artisan test` and `RefreshDatabase`.
- Write feature tests using factories and assertions (`assertJson`, `assertStatus`).
- Test full request → response → auth flow.

## Queues & Jobs
- Use `php artisan make:job` for deferred tasks.
- Dispatch with `dispatch()` or `dispatchSync()`.
- Monitor queues with Horizon if using Redis.

## DB & Migrations
- Use `foreignId()->constrained()` for FK relationships.
- Add indexes where needed.
- Use factories and seeders for test/dev data.

## Caching & Optimization
- Use `Cache::remember()` for heavy queries.
- Use `php artisan config:cache` and `route:cache` in production.
- Consider Octane for high-performance workloads.

## Events & Observers
- Use events to decouple logic.
- Use model observers for lifecycle hooks (created, updated, deleted).

=== .ai/testing-ai-guidelines rules ===

## Testing instructions

### General Guidelines
- Use Pest and not PHPUnit. Run tests with `php artisan test`.
  - Every test method should be structured with Arrange-Act-Assert.
  ** In the Arrange phase, 
    - use Laravel factories but add meaningful column values and variable names if they help to understand failed tests better. Bad example: `$user1 = User::factory()->create();`.Better example: `$adminUser = User::factory()->create(['email' => 'admin@admin.com'])`;
  ** In the Assert phase, perform these assertions when applicable:
    - HTTP status code returned from Act: `assertStatus()`
    - Structure/data returned from Act (Blade or JSON): functions like `assertViewHas()`, `assertSee()`, `assertDontSee()` or `assertJsonContains()`
    - Or, redirect assertions like `assertRedirect()` and `assertSessionHas()` in case of Flash session values passed
    - DB changes if any create/update/delete operation was performed: functions like `assertDatabaseHas()`, `assertDatabaseMissing()`, `expect($variable)->toBe()` and similar.

### Before Writing Tests

1. **Check database schema** - Use `database-schema` tool to understand:
    - Which columns have defaults
    - Which columns are nullable
    - Foreign key relationship names

2. **Verify relationship names** - Read the model file to confirm:
    - Exact relationship method names (not assumed from column names)
    - Return types and related models

3. **Test realistic states** - Don't assume:
    - Empty model = all nulls (check for defaults)
    - `user_id` foreign key = `user()` relationship (could be `author()`, `employer()`, etc.)
    - When testing form submissions that redirect back with errors, assert that old input is preserved using `assertSessionHasOldInput()`
- ## Testing instructions

=== .ai/filament-v4 rules ===

## Filament General Rules

- When generating Filament resource, you MUST generate Filament smoke tests to check if the Resource works. When making changes to Filament resource, you MUST run the tests (generate them if they don't exist) and make changes to resource/tests to make the tests pass.
- When generating Filament resource, don't generate View page or Infolist, unless specifically instructed.
- When referencing the Filament routes, aim to use `getUrl()` instead of Laravel `route()`. Instead of `route('filament.admin.resources.class-schedules.index')`, use `ClassScheduleResource::getUrl('index')`. Also, specify the exacy Resource name, instead of `getResource()`.
- When writing tests with Pest, use syntax `Livewire::test(class)` and not `livewire(class)`, to avoid extra dependency on `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire`.
- When using Enum class for Eloquent Model field, use Enum `HasLabel`, `HasColor` and `HasIcon` instead of specifying values/labels/colors/icons inside of Filament Forms/Tables. Refer to this docs page: https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/advanced/enums

---

## Filament Version 4 Rules

List of important changes in Filament v4 vs Filament v3:

- Validation rule `unique()` has `ignoreRecord: true` by default, no need to specify it.
- Don't use full namespaces when referencing Filament classes like `Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker`. Always put the namespaces in `use` section on top and use only classname instead of full path.
- If you create custom Blade files with Tailwind classes, you need to create a custom theme and specify the folder of those Blade files in theme.css.
- Table Filters have `->schema()` instead of `->form()`
- `Action::make()` has `->schema()` instead of `->form()`
- Table has `->toolbarActions()` instead of `->bulkActions()`
- `Get`, `Set`, and other form utilities are now in `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get` and not in `Filament\Forms\Get`
- Layout Components Moved: Grid, Section, Fieldset, etc. are now in `Filament\Schemas\Components\` and not in `Filament\Forms\Components\`

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.16
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `vendor/bin/sail npm run build`, `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`, or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The `search-docs` tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something very complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== sail rules ===

## Laravel Sail

- This project runs inside Laravel Sail's Docker containers. You MUST execute all commands through Sail.
- Start services using `vendor/bin/sail up -d` and stop them with `vendor/bin/sail stop`.
- Open the application in the browser by running `vendor/bin/sail open`.
- Always prefix PHP, Artisan, Composer, and Node commands with `vendor/bin/sail`. Examples:
    - Run Artisan Commands: `vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`
    - Install Composer packages: `vendor/bin/sail composer install`
    - Execute Node commands: `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`
    - Execute PHP scripts: `vendor/bin/sail php [script]`
- View all available Sail commands by running `vendor/bin/sail` without arguments.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `vendor/bin/sail npm run build` or ask the user to run `vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` or `vendor/bin/sail composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire

- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version-specific documentation for how to write Livewire and Livewire tests.
- Use the `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` Artisan command to create new components.
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend; they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle Hook Examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>

## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire Component Test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Livewire Component Exists on Page" lang="php">
    $this->get('/posts/create')
    ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
</code-snippet>

=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 3, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire; don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="Livewire Init Hook Example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/sail bin pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

## PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `vendor/bin/sail artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `vendor/bin/sail artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML; check and use existing Tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc.).
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults. Remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, and group elements logically.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing; don't use margins.

<code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
    <div class="flex gap-8">
        <div>Superior</div>
        <div>Michigan</div>
        <div>Erie</div>
    </div>
</code-snippet>

### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.

=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind CSS 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4; do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.

<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>

### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option; use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |
</laravel-boost-guidelines>
